About Me, purrrrr, Us

We want you to take control of your safety. With Justice Cat!, gone are the days of asking around if a neighborhood is safe, if someone can escort you to a car parked on a side street, and all around wondering the best way to get from point A to point B late nights. Welcome back the ability to unexpectedly stay late at an event.

We provide a resource to collect all of that normally unreported activity. Like verbal or sexual harassment, stalking, or physical intimidation. No need to fill out reports or be scared of going to authorities. Justice Cat! is an anonymous crowdsourcing platform, for all of the things you want to be aware of while using public transit but don’t necessarily hear about.

We are like Google Maps’ traffic view for unwanted activities. Use the app to map out your trip against reported activity. Filter by type of activity or time of reporting. Then, Just Cat! provides a visualization of your route against reports. As an option, get alerts of reports as you travel. Finally, you can find your way with confidence.
