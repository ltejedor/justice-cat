About Me, purrrrr, Us

We want you to take control of your safety. With Justice Cat, gone are the days of asking around if a neighborhood is safe, if someone can escort you to a car parked on a side street, and all around wondering the best way to get from point A to point B late nights. Welcome back the ability to unexpectedly stay late at an event.

We provide a resource to crowdsource information about street incidents that normally goes unreported. Like verbal or sexual harassment, stalking, or physical intimidation. No need to fill out reports or be scared of going to authorities. Justice Cat is completely anonymous.

We are like Google Mapsâ€™ traffic view for unwanted activities. Use the app to map out your trip against reported activity. Filter by type of activity or time of reporting. Then, Justice Cat provides a visualization of your route against reports. As an option, get alerts of reports as you travel. Finally, you can find your way with confidence.
